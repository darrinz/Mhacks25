        "question": "What key topics, decisions, or agenda items are most important for us to cover in this meeting to make the best use of our time?",
        "response": "We need to officially kick off Project Orion by agreeing on the high-level goals for the quarter. I've prepared a document with some proposals. Secondly, I want to discuss the key takeaways from the Project Nova retrospective survey that everyone filled out last week."
      },
      {
        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "I have synthesized the 50+ anonymous responses from the retro survey into key themes, which I can present. The main positive theme was team collaboration, and the main negative was perceived timeline pressure. I'm also taking next Friday off, just as a heads-up."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the most significant blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",
        "response": "The primary risk for Project Orion is scope creep. We need to leave this meeting with a firm agreement on what we are *not* doing this quarter. I need the team's help to commit to a focused plan."

        "question": "What key topics, decisions, or agenda items are most important for us to cover in this meeting to make the best use of our time?",
        "response": "My main topic is the urgent need to allocate time this quarter to pay down our technical debt. We accumulated a lot of it during the final push for Project Nova, and our codebase is becoming brittle."
      },
      {
        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "I've cataloged the major areas of tech debt, including the need to refactor our authentication service and upgrade our primary database from Postgres 12 to 15. The database upgrade alone will require a full weekend of planned downtime."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the most significant blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",
        "response": "The blocker is that 'paying down tech debt' is never a feature we can sell, so it's always the first thing to get cut from the plan. The risk of not doing it is a future major outage or security breach. I need a commitment for at least 20% of our engineering capacity this quarter to be dedicated to this."

        "response": "I want to propose that we officially adopt the new 'Momentum' Design System for Project Orion. I also have a question about the process for getting user research participants, it seems really slow right now."

      {
        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "I've created a demo of the proposed design system in Storybook that shows how it would accelerate our frontend development by providing ready-made, accessible components. This should make our whole process smoother."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the most significant blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",
        "response": "The challenge is that adopting the new system will require a one-time effort from the frontend team to learn it and integrate it into our build process. It will slow us down for the first two weeks before it speeds us up. We need the team to agree to this initial investment."

        "response": "I need to bring up the persistent 'Image Caching Bug' from Project Nova. It was de-prioritized during the launch rush, but it's causing real issues for our users and flooding customer support with tickets."

        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "I've done a root cause analysis and I have a fix ready. It involves changing how we generate ETags for image assets. My new mechanical keyboard is amazing, by the way, typing has never been more satisfying."

        "question": "What are the most significant blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",

      {
        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "Our end-to-end tests are still really flaky. They fail about 30% of the time due to timing issues, not actual bugs. This slows down every single deployment and makes it hard to trust our test suite. The team has been doing a great job with writing unit tests, though."

      {
        "question": "What are the most significant blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",
        "response": "The risk is that we either ship a critical bug because we don't trust our tests, or we slow our development velocity to a crawl with manual testing. I want to propose we invest in a better testing tool like 'Cypress' and dedicate a full sprint to improving test stability."

        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "The complaints are: 1) The search feature is slow and inaccurate, 2) The mobile web experience is poor, and 3) It's too hard to export data. I've compiled a report with specific customer quotes for each. Also, our new support team member, Sam, starts tomorrow."

        "response": "The data shows that while new user acquisition was high after the Nova launch, our 30-day retention rate was 10% lower than our goal. This suggests users liked the concept but didn't find long-term value. For Orion, I propose we focus on a 'North Star' metric of weekly active users."
