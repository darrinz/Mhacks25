We've determined that a scalable implementation would require us to migrate our entire rendering engine from Canvas2D to WebGL, which is a massive undertaking. The PoC is functional but suffers from significant memory leaks when more than 200 nodes are added to the canvas."

The risk is that we commit to this feature and are forced to cut corners, resulting in a slow, buggy, and unusable product. My team's estimate is that doing this *right* will delay the Nebula project by a minimum of 3 months. I am also blocked on getting the budget approved for our new CI/CD server."

We showed the mockups to our top 10 enterprise clients and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive."
