        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",

        "response": "My team has been reviewing OmniCorp's API documentation. It's a 15-year-old SOAP API with no documentation for key endpoints and an average response time of over 2 seconds. It uses XML for everything and requires us to build a custom authentication library from scratch. For those who are technical, it uses a WS-Security standard that has been deprecated for years."

        "question": "Are there any blockers, risks, or challenges you're currently facing right now? Where do you need help or a decision from the team?",
        "response": "The blocker is the technical quality of their API. The risk is that we couple our modern, fast, reliable platform to their slow, brittle, and insecure one. This integration will be a permanent source of bugs and performance issues. I cannot in good conscience sign off on this integration plan."

        "response": "I've mapped their proposed features to our existing Q4/Q1 roadmap. Their requests would require us to delay our planned 'AI Assistant' feature by at least two quarters to focus on building integration-specific features for them. By the way, the monthly user analytics report is ready and will be sent out tomorrow."

        "question": "On any of the key topics (yours or others'), what progress have you made, contributions can you share, or updates can you provide since our last sync?",
        "response": "I have reviewed the contract. OmniCorp is only willing to commit to a 99.0% uptime SLA for their API, which is equivalent to over 7 hours of downtime per month. Our own product has a 99.95% uptime SLA. We would be in breach of our own SLA with customers if their API goes down."

        "response": "We have designed a user flow that tries to hide the slowness of OmniCorp's API by using loading skeletons and optimistic updates, but it can only do so much. A 2-second delay is going to feel broken no matter how nice the loading spinner is."

        "response": "Instead of a deep, server-to-server integration, we could build a lighter-weight 'connector' that runs on the client-side. It would be slower and less powerful, but it would isolate our core platform from their legacy systems and could be built in a fraction of the time."
