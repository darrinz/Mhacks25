        "goal": (
            "**PRIMARY GOALS:**\n"
            "1.  **Synthesize:** Group all related comments, questions, and proposals from the structured inputs into unified topics.\n"
            "2.  **Prioritize:** Rank the synthesized topics based on urgency and importance to ensure the meeting focuses on what matters most.\n"
            "3.  **Structure:** Compile all relevant discussion points for each topic so context is not lost, while still separating out purely informational updates and deep technical details for an email.\n\n"
            "**DEFINITIONS:**\n"
            "-   **Meeting-Worthy Content:** Topics that require the collective intelligence of the group to solve, decide, or align on. The output for these topics must include a summary of all submitted perspectives.\n"
            "-   **Email-Worthy Content:** Information that does not benefit from real-time group discussion. This includes:\n"
            "    1.  **F.Y.I. Updates:** Simple status updates that are purely informational.\n"
            "    2.  **Technical Details:** Deeply technical specifications, data, or notes that support a meeting topic but would bog down the main discussion.\n\n"
            "**TASK:**\n"
            "You will be given a JSON array where each object represents a participant's full, standardized response.\n"
            "1.  Analyze the entire json array of participant objects provided at the end of the message, NOT the example, that is only for formatting style and for you to know what to expect.\n"
            "2.  **Use Context:** Pay close attention to the `question` text for each `answer`. An answer to \"Are there any blockers...?\" is inherently more urgent than an answer to \"Is there any other information...?\".\n"
            "3.  **Group and Synthesize:** Identify distinct topics by analyzing answers across all participants. Group all related points, even if they come from answers to different questions (e.g., a \"topic\" in Q1 can be related to a \"blocker\" in Q3).\n"
            "4.  **Prioritize and Rank:** For each synthesized meeting topic, determine its priority ('High', 'Medium', or 'Low'). Base this on:\n"
            "    a. **Frequency:** How many participants raised the topic.\n"
            "    b. **Inherent Importance:** Blockers, strategic decisions, and conflicts are higher priority than general updates.\n"
            "5.  **Compile Details:** For each meeting topic, create a concise summary that includes all related points, questions, and perspectives. When referencing people in the summary text, use only the name part of their email address (before the @ symbol) for readability. However, in the `submitted_by` array, use the full email addresses.\n"
            "6.  **Classify Email Content:** Identify and separate all small details that do not need to be talked about at the meeting into the `email_content` list. Do not provide an explanation. These will be just used in email updates. \n"
            "7.  **Format Output:** Structure your final output as a single JSON object.\n\n"
            "8.  **CRITICAL EMAIL RULE:** When populating the `submitted_by` array, you MUST use the exact string value from the `user` key (email address) of the corresponding input participant object. You are explicitly forbidden from using generic placeholders like 'Participant 1', 'Participant 2', etc. Failure to use the real email addresses is a failure of the entire task."
            "9.  **Final Verification:** Before providing the final JSON, review the `submitted_by` arrays you have created. For every entry, confirm that it is an actual email address taken directly from the input data and not a placeholder."
            "**IMPORTANT:** Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not add any commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.\n\n"
